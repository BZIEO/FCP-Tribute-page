        <h2>A timeline of Ethereum</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>2013</b> - The introductory paper was published by Vitalik
            Buterin on November 27th.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>2014</b> - The Yellow Paper released, authored by Dr. Gavin Wood,
            is a technical definition of the Ethereum protocol. Three months
            later on July 22nd, Ethereum went on sale for 42 days starting at
            2000 ETH / 1 BTC.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>2015</b> - Frontier was alive, but barebone implementation of the
            Ethereum project. It followed the successful Olympic testing phase.
            It was intended for technical users, specifically developers. Blocks
            had a gas limit of 5,000. This ‘thawing’ period enabled miners to
            start their operations and for early adopters to install their
            clients without having to ‘rush’. Two months later on September 7th,
            The frontier thawing fork lifted the 5,000 gas limit per block and
            set the default gas price to 51 gwei. This allowed for transactions
            – transactions require 21,000 gas. 1 Ethereum = $1.24
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>2016</b> - The Homestead fork that looked to the future. It
            included several protocol changes and a networking change that gave
            Ethereum the ability to do further network upgrades. The DAO fork
            was in response to the 2016 DAO attack where an insecure DAO
            contract was drained of over 3.6 million ETH in a hack. The fork
            moved the funds from the faulty contract to a new contract with a
            single function: withdraw. Anyone who lost funds could withdraw 1
            ETH for every 100 DAO tokens in their wallets. This course of action
            was voted on by the Ethereum community. Any ETH holder was able to
            vote via a transaction on a voting platform. The decision to fork
            reached over 85% of the votes. Some miners refused to fork because
            the DAO incident wasn't a defect in the protocol. They went on to
            form Ethereum Classic. 1 Ethereum = $12.50
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>2017</b> - The Byzantium fork: Reduced block mining rewards from
            5 to 3 ETH. Delayed the difficulty bomb by a year.It added the
            ability to make non-state-changing calls to other contracts. Added
            certain cryptography methods to allow for layer 2 scaling. 1
            Ethereum = $334.23
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>2019</b> - The Constantinople fork: Ensured the blockchain didn't
            freeze before proof-of-stake was implemented. Optimised the gas cost
            of certain actions in the EVM. Added the ability to interact with
            addresses that haven't been created yet. <br />The Istanbul fork:
            Optimised the gas cost of certain actions in the EVM. Improved
            denial-of-service attack resilience. Made Layer 2 scaling solutions
            based on SNARKs and STARKs more performant. Enabled Ethereum and
            Zcash to interoperate. Allowed contracts to introduce more creative
            functions. 1 Ethereum = $151.06
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>2020</b> - The Muir Glacier fork introduced a delay to the
            difficulty bomb. Increases in block difficulty of the proof-of-work
            consensus mechanism threatened to degrade the usability of Ethereum
            by increasing wait times for sending transactions and using dapps.
            Later that year in October, the staking deposit contract was
            deployed. The staking deposit contract introduced staking to the
            Ethereum ecosystem. Although a Mainnet contract, it had a direct
            impact on the timeline for launching the Beacon Chain, an important
            Eth2 upgrade. The Beacon Chain needed 16384 deposits of 32 staked
            ETH to ship securely. This happened on November 27, meaning the
            Beacon Chain started producing blocks on December 1, 2020. This is
            an important first step in achieving the Eth2 vision. 1 Ethereum =
            $586.23
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>2021</b> - The London upgrade introduced EIP-1559, which reformed
            the transaction fee market, along with changes to how gas refunds
            are handled and the Ice Age schedule. The Altair upgrade was the
            first scheduled upgrade for the Beacon Chain. It added support for
            "sync committees"—enabling light clients, and bringing validator
            inactivity and slashing penalties up to their full values. Altair
            was the first major network upgrade that had an exact rollout time.
            Every upgrade prior had been based on a declared block number on the
            proof-of-work chain, where block times vary. The Beacon Chain does
            not require solving for proof-of-work, and instead works on a
            time-based epoch system consisting of 32 twelve-second "slots" of
            time where validators can propose blocks. This is why we knew
            exactly when we would hit epoch 74,240 and Altair became live! 1
